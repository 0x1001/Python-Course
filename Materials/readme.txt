This folder contains extra materials I use for python course.

- Course.ipynb - Jupyter notbook with several python examples
To open it you need to install Jupyter - Python web interpreter.
http://jupyter.org/

I recommend following steps for installation:
- In this folder create python virtual environment: 
	python -m venv .venv
- Activate it:
	call .venv/Scripts/activate.bat
- Install Jupyter
	pip install -r requirements_for_jupyter.txt
	(or pip install jupyter)
- To start Jupyter use:
	jupyter notebook
