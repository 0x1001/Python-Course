Lesson 0

Gol is to get you setup right and be able to commit things.
In README.md there is a description of what you need to install. Just follow it.

Once you've done with the installation, create new project in pyCharm and write 'hello world' application.
To be more specific: Write a function that prints 'Hello world' and invoke that function from main program entry.

What is this main program entry or in other words main function in python?
Answer is: if __name__ == '__main__'

Once you have that create a second python file and import in it the first file. Call your function in the second file.
You should see only one print of Hello world. You can also play around with __name__ variable.
Try to print it from your function and see the difference between running this function from the first file and
running it from the second file.

Once you create your program in Solutions/<yourname>/Lesson_0/ commit it to git and push it to git hub.
Then we will review it together.
